# Nearby Notes App

In this project I created a simple notes app that saves the location data of the note's maker, and saved it to a realtime database called Firebase Firestore.

In the notes list page, there is indicator on where is the note created and the distance to that location. I also added that the home screen only shows notes created nearby (created not too far away).

This project could be helpful in developing smart cities. Users can get updates what others have taken notes at that location, for example road holes, traffic jams, etc.
